Decent Sampler (x86_64)
=======================

Thanks for downloading the Linux build of Decent Sampler. The latest version can always be found here: https://www.decentsamples.com/product/decent-sampler-plugin/

This build was compiled on an older Ubuntu 18.04 machine for maximum compatibility. There are two Linux versions of Decent Sampler available–one that references dynamic versions of libraries and one that attempt to statically link to as many libraries as possible. If one version doesn't work on your Linux box, give the other a try. 

Here is a description of the files in this archive:

- DecentSampler: This is a **Standalone app** version of the plugin. You should be able to run this from the command-line.
- DecentSampler.so: This is the **VST2 version** of the plugin. You should put this wherever your legacy VST plugins go.
- DecentSampler.vst3: This is the **VST3 version** of the plugin. You should put this wherever your VST3 plugins go.

DecentSampler for Linux stores its config files in ~/.config/DecentSampler.

Enjoy!
